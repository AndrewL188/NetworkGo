# Final Project Proposal

My proposal for the final project is a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to play the game of go against another player over a network. Go is a strategy game popular in East Asian countries that involves players alternating placing white and black stones on a 19x19 (or in some simplified versions, a 9x9) grid. The goal of the game is to surround more "territory", or empty intersections on the grid, than their opponent. 

This project will be primarily comprised of 2 features: a graphical user interface indicating the state of the board that allows a player to click on the location they wish to play, and a networked aspect that allows users to play over different screens. Consequently, Iâ€™ve identified two libraries provided by openFrameworks that will be crucial to my project: ofxGUI and ofxNetwork - each of which correspond, respectively, to the two features of the project mentioned above. 

As for a more challenging extension of the project, I would like to write a simple AI that a user can opt to play against (rather than another human player). 

Although I do not much have experience writing software of this scale, I do have much experience in the actual game of go (I have been playing since I was 11 years old), and therefore have a relatively clear picture of the components that I need and the short-term goals I should set for myself in implementing this project.
