# Development Documentation

## Week 1
This week I got the GUI and the basic layout of my game engine working, allowing the user to place pieces on the board by clicking in the window.


## Week 2
Got the game engine fully functioning, with rules specified in https://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html. For scoring, I implemented the Chinese counting system, and players are expected to captures all dead stones within their territory before counting begins. For kos, I implemented a version of go where repeated board positions ARE allowed.
